# Housing Insights - Coding and Workflow conventions

# Git conventions
We use a fork-and-pull request method, which should be familiar to most people who have contributed to an open source project before. When you're starting the project, it's easy:

1. Click 'fork' in the upper right of this page.
1. Click you will now be on *your* copy of the repo on Github (look for YourUserName/housing-insights in the upper left).
1. Click the green 'Clone' button from **your** copy (not the CodeForDC copy)
1. Once you've cloned it to your computer, make a new branch for your feature and then start coding!
1. Push your local changes to your fork regularly
1. When you're done, go to your fork of the repo on Github, make a pull request, and be sure to select 'base fork' on the left (Code for DC) and your fork on the right.

#### Important** <br/>
But! Don't forget that if changes happen on the Code for DC repo, you need to sync that code

**Easy Way**


**Professional Way**
If you want to get fancy, the Github blog has a good walkthrough of setting up two remote repositories (e.g. this repository and your fork of it) and using this to work in a triangular workflow. Here's [the description](https://github.com/blog/2042-git-2-5-including-multiple-worktrees-and-triangular-workflows#improved-support-for-triangular-workflows) (scroll down to 'Improved support...').
